                        <p class="mb-5">MyPhilanthropies is a non-profit organization in Irvine, California that promotes connectivity between
                            project leaders and a network of volunteers. As the scope grew, the company faced a problem with storing and matching
                            their volunteers with opportunities that fit their skillset.</p>
                        <p>
                            They decided to partner up with students from UCI to create a brand-new system that supported
                            their organizational needs. I joined the team as a front-end developer.

                <h1 class="text-center strawberry-text text-red-600 text-4xl mb-10">The Problem</h1>
                <p class="lg:text-xl text-red-400 font-bold">Programs and events are continuously being added, removed, or changed.</p>
                    <p class="ml-10 mt-5 mb-5"> Volunteers required up-to-date information to properly help at events. 
                        To stay efficient with limited human resource, the company needed a way to reach out to many people with minimal work. 
                    </p>
                <p class="lg:text-xl text-red-400 font-bold">Excel sheets took too long to fill out.</p>
                    <p class="ml-10 mt-5 mb-5">As an upcoming nonprofit company, they only had one person keeping track of all volunteer information. 
                        There were columns for volunteer names, age, skillset, and contact information.
                        This became increasingly difficult to maintain as they gained more volunteers.
                    </p>
                <p class="lg:text-xl text-red-400 font-bold">Volunteers had to be manually called or e-mailed for every event, which often led to ghosting.</p>
                    <p class="ml-10 mt-5 mb-5">The current system had the company call or email each individual whenever an event arose.
                        This led them to miss a few volunteers that had the required skills, and volunteers often didn't check for new events if they missed a call or email.

                <p class="mt-10 mb-10">
                    Before we started programming anything, we began to design <span class="text-red-400">UML class diagrams</span> and <span class="text-red-400">sequence diagrams</span> to determine the different
                    parts of the website we needed to create and their functions.

                <p class="ml-10 mt-5 mb-5"> We created a user database that allows for our clients to keep all information about the volunteers in one place.
                    They no longer had to manually input things into an excel sheet such as name, age, and contact information. As soon as volunteers signed up, that data would be stored
                    and be available for the admins to view at any time.
                </p>
                <p class="ml-10 mt-5 mb-5"> The more robust sign up process gave insight on what kind of volunteer they are dealing with and a general idea of their schedules. For example,
                    unemployed volunteers could dedicate more time than full-time students.
                    This also added a section which gave admins knowledge on the best way to communicate with volunteers.

                <p class="ml-10 mt-5 mb-5"> 
                    In order to make viewing event information easier, we created a list of events in the form of cards.
                    Each card contained the event name, the date, the location, icons for skills needed, and a search bar to make filtering easier.
                    We also included a navigation sidebar. Home would take users back to this page, inbox would be a in-app messaging system, 
                    events would lead users to events they've saved or signed up to, and settings would allows users to update their information.

                <p class="mt-10 lg:text-xl text-red-400 font-bold">The Technology</p>
                <p class="ml-10 mt-5"> 
                    This project had a difficult learning curve. This was the first time I ever worked with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
                    I spent countless of hours&#8212days even&#8212just to learn how ajax requests worked using jQuery for the sign up system.
                    It was especially difficult learning about authentication keys and security measure we needed to secure users' personal information.
                </p>
                <p class="ml-10 mt-5 mb-5"> 
                    Halfway through the project, my team members and I realized that working with frameworks such as React or Angular would have made 
                    web development so much easier with their various libraries that supported the functionalities we needed to build. 
                    Coding in vanilla, however, was a painful but essential learning experience.

                    Our clients are well-versed in fine arts. They are actors, singers, business leaders&#8212not programmers.
                    They had a vision for the "what" but not the "how". The ability to guide and explain design decisions
                    became necessary to ensure customer happiness throughout the project. Meetings with our sponsors used a different dictionary
                    than presenting the project to our classmates.

                <p class="ml-10 mt-5 mb-5"> 
                    The quarter system is unforgiving. Even more so when working with a project of this size with real clients.
                    It became important that every single person had a role and was aware of what others were doing so no two people overlapped.
                    Communication, a skill that many members in group work struggle with, played a vital role in keeping things on track.
                </p>
                <p class="ml-10 mt-5 mb-5"> 
                    Sprint backlogs and reports became second-nature to us. Slack messages were continously being exchanged 24/7 as we developped and bug fixed 
                    on the same day. Pushing and pulling from GitHub repositories, and solving merge conflicts, became as easy pressing CTRL + S in 
                    code editors.

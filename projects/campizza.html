                        <p class="mb-5">Camp Izza is a non-profit summer camp for children aged 5-11, located in Irvine, California.
                            In order to promote social good, my group wanted to redesign the website 
                            for a better user experience. At the time, the website had many unclear affordances,
                            gaps in information, and did not support recovery from mistakes.

                    <h1 class="text-center strawberry-text text-red-600 text-5xl mb-10">The Problem</h1>
                    <p class="lg:text-xl text-red-400 font-bold">Information is difficult to find.</p>
                    <p class="ml-10 mt-5 mb-5">
                          The information architecture of the website made it hard for users to find the information they were looking for.
                          It often led users to remain "stuck" in their user flow and ultimately led them away from Camp Izza's services.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lg:text-xl text-red-400 font-bold">The UI is inconsistent</p>
                    <p class="ml-10 mt-5 mb-5">
                        The visual aesthetic of the website was inconsistent. Thus, affordances were unclear for the user. Was the button clickable, or was
                        it simply text? Some color combinations and fonts made reading near impossible in certain pages.
                  </p>
                    <p class="lg:text-xl text-red-400 font-bold">Website exploration is annoying.</p>
                    <p class="ml-10 mt-5 mb-5">
                        There is no easy back button. Sometimes, user navigation is abruptly cut short because there's no button that takes the user
                        back to where they are. If input information is wrong, users had to re-do an entire form because their input is not saved.
                  </p>

                <div class="mt-16">
                    <h1 class="text-center strawberry-text text-red-600 text-5xl">The Research</h1>
                    <p class="mt-10 mb-10">
                        One of the first user research methods we used was <span class="text-red-400">competitive analysis</span>.
                        We named two direct competitors, Outta Bound Events and Camp James. The first is a non-profit organization 
                        that provides after-school/summer programs for children aged 5 to 14. The second is a summer camp for children
                        aged 4 to 13.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-10 mb-10">
                        Our indirect competitors are SuperCamp by Quantum Learning and Orange County Cal Ripken (OCCR). SuperCamp is aimed for older
                        children, from sixth grade all the way to college students. They're focused on teaching classes about life
                        skills. OCCR is an organization for children 3-18 that offers softball and baseball programs. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-10 mb-10">
                        Looking at our competitors' websites, it is clear that each had better information hierarchy. In particular,
                        Outta Bounds contained more information about each program in their pages and had a better navigation bar. 
                        Another advantage the sites had is a clear color palette. They stuck to a few colors and fonts which made it easier
                        on the users' eyes. The competitive analysis solidified our goals and served as a confirmation that
                        the problems we aimed for our redesign will help Camp Izza stand beside its competitors.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-10 mb-10">
                        The next user research methods we used were <span class="text-red-400">interviews</span> and <span class="text-red-400">surveys</span>.
                        We conducted our interviews on a total of 10 parents, our primary stakeholders, and posted our survey on Facebook groups for parents/guardians. 
                        Our survey was created using Google Survey, which garnered 20 responses, and we were able to utilize their built-in analytics for each question. We decided the best way to organize our findings is by creating <span class="text-red-400">affinity maps</span>.  
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-10 mb-10">
                        From our affinity maps, we decided to create our <span class="text-red-400">personas</span>. We created a total of three with varying
                        backgrounds and personality traits.

                        After finalizing our user base and uncovering their values, we moved onto dissecting the usability issues. 
                        We used <span class="text-red-400">user testing</span>, accompanied by the <span class="text-red-400">think-aloud method</span>, and 
                        had a <span class="text-red-400">post-task questionnaire</span> prepared.

                    <p class="mt-10 mb-10">
                        Our second user testing method was a <span class="text-red-400">cognitive walkthrough</span>. We created
                        an action sequence and answered four questions.

                            <li class="mb-3">Are the necessary actions obviously available in the interface?</li>
                            <li class="mb-3">Once users see the control, will they recognize that it does what they want? In other words, does the label for the correct action match the user's goals? What are plausible reasons why a user might not recognize that the control does what they want?</li>
                            <li>If the user performs the correct action, will they get good feedback and not try to undo or redo the action?</li>

                    <p class="mt-10 mb-10">
                        The first usability issue was the buttons. They came in non-standard shapes and unclear labelling, which made them
                        easy to miss for our users. Another usability issue was that some pages simply needed more information as to what
                        the program has to offer. The last came with trust and security: users did not feel comfortable using Google Forms and inputting
                        sensitive information such as their address and financial situations.

                        We created a more simple color palette, sticking to six colors with gray and black for text. 
                        Moving away from bright color, we came up with an earthy, neutral color story to better appeal to 
                        parents and create a modern, professional feel. We also stuck to one font (Open Sans) to be used 
                        in all of our assets.

                        Our users were often confused on amenities the camp had such as the Lunch Mob Program,
                        activities kids would participate in throughout the day, and signing up for financial aid packages.

                        Initially, the Lunch Mob page would only contain a link instead of explaining to potential parents
                        the services they provided for the camp. We added the Learn More button to act as the gateway to an external site,
                        but we also created a section for a menu so that parents are aware of the type of meals their children could be eating. 
                        Underneath, the prices are listed with an appropriate Sign Up button that will link users to a check-out page where
                        they can input their payment.

                        Moving on to the activities page, the original calendar on their website was a static image that simply had the calendar date and theme of the day.

                        Our redesign aimed at making the calendar more interactable. Instead of displaying the full month,
                        the calendar would be split into a week with five days. The left would keep the theme and date, while the 
                        right window aimed at showing a description of the activities, how many children signed up, how many staff are 
                        present, and the time. These are all essential information that our users from surveys and interviews requested.

                        focused on presenting information in a clearer manner.

                <p class="ml-10 mt-5 mb-5"> 
                    User research requires... you guess it... users! Unfortunately, we were not able to get in touch with our
                    primary stakeholders. We compromised by finding potential users instead: parents with children and would use summer camp programs
                    like Camp Izza. Most of our interviews were conducted through phones and our surveys were posted
                    on platforms such as Facebook groups aimed at moms and the Irvine neighborhood.

                    All of our design decisions had something to back it up. We changed how buttons looked because user testing showed
                    that people had trouble finding the next step to their user flow. We added information based on what our users said
                    they would like to see. Though researching is long and tedious, ultimately, each design choice was informed and backed by real needs. 
                    We didn't change the layout because it simply looked better; we did it to improve user retention and prevent user errors.

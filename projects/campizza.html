                        <p class="mb-5">Camp Izza is a non-profit summer camp for children aged 5-11, located in Irvine, California.
                            In order to promote social good, my group wanted to redesign the website 
                            for a better user experience. At the time, the website had many unclear affordances,
                            gaps in information, and did not support recovery from mistakes.

                    <h1 class="text-center strawberry-text text-red-600 text-5xl mb-10">The Problem</h1>
                    <p class="lg:text-xl text-red-400 font-bold">Information is difficult to find.</p>
                    <p class="ml-10 mt-5 mb-5">
                          The information architecture of the website made it hard for users to find the information they were looking for.
                          It often led users to remain "stuck" in their user flow and ultimately led them away from Camp Izza's services.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lg:text-xl text-red-400 font-bold">The UI is inconsistent</p>
                    <p class="ml-10 mt-5 mb-5">
                        The visual aesthetic of the website was inconsistent. Thus, affordances were unclear for the user. Was the button clickable, or was
                        it simply text? Some color combinations and fonts made reading near impossible in certain pages.
                  </p>
                    <p class="lg:text-xl text-red-400 font-bold">Website exploration is annoying.</p>
                    <p class="ml-10 mt-5 mb-5">
                        There is no easy back button. Sometimes, user navigation is abruptly cut short because there's no button that takes the user
                        back to where they are. If input information is wrong, users had to re-do an entire form because their input is not saved.

                    <h1 class="text-center strawberry-text text-red-600 text-5xl">The Research</h1>
                    <p class="mt-10 mb-5">
                        One of the first user research methods we used was <span class="text-red-400">competitive analysis</span>.
                        We named two direct competitors, Outta Bound Events and Camp James. The first is a non-profit organization 
                        that provides after-school/summer programs for children aged 5 to 14. The second is a summer camp for children
                        aged 4 to 13.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-10 mb-5">
                        Our indirect competitors are SuperCamp by Quantum Learning and Orange County Cal Ripken (OCCR). SuperCamp is aimed for older
                        children, from sixth grade all the way to college students. They're focused on teaching classes about life
                        skills. OCCR is an organization for children 3-18 that offers softball and baseball programs. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-10 mb-5">
                        Looking at our competitors' websites, it is clear that each had better information hierarchy. In particular,
                        Outta Bounds contained more information about each program in their pages and had a better navigation bar. 
                        Another advantage the sites had is a clear color palette. They stuck to a few colors and fonts which made it easier
                        on the users' eyes. The competitive analysis solidified our goals and served as a confirmation that
                        the problems we aimed for our redesign will help Camp Izza stand beside its competitors.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-10 mb-5">
                        The next user research methods we used were <span class="text-red-400">interviews</span> and <span class="text-red-400">surveys</span>.
                        We conducted our interviews on a total of 10 parents, our primary stakeholders, and posted our survey on Facebook groups for parents/guardians. 
                        Our survey was created using Google Survey, which garnered 20 responses, and we were able to utilize their built-in analytics for each question. We decided the best way to organize our findings is by creating <span class="text-red-400">affinity maps</span>.  
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-10 mb-5">
                        From our affinity maps, we decided to create our <span class="text-red-400">personas</span>. We created a total of three with varying
                        backgrounds and personality traits.

                        After finalizing our user base and uncovering their values, we moved onto dissecting the usability issues. 
                        We used <span class="text-red-400">user testing</span>, accompanied by the <span class="text-red-400">think-aloud method</span>, and 
                        had a <span class="text-red-400">post-task questionnaire</span> prepared.

            MyPhilanthropies is a non-profit organization based in Irvine, California. 
            They connect philanthropy groups with interested volunteers to promote cooperation
            between like-minded people.
          </p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            When my team and I partnered up with MyPhilanthropies, they were looking for a way to expand their network.
            However, they needed to streamline a lot of their operations because they had a fairly small team running
            the organization.
          </p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            In this project, I worked as a UX designer and front-end developer. For ten weeks, we collaborated to design and develop a web application
            that would make registering and tracking volunteers for philanthropy groups easier.

            Nobody in my team had any experience working with entrepeneurs and the networking that goes behind it. We relied
            on two employees to get the gist of the current system in place. Each philanthropy group within MyPhilanthropies' network
            hosted their own set of events that needed volunteers with certain skills. For example, one project required
            house building skills and manual labor.

            Planty is a mental health mobile application that aims to improve users' mental health by
            fostering a sense of ownership and accountability. We were tasked to design an app that would
            tackle mental health using AR technologies.
          </p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            I worked in a team of six as the user researcher. We designed this app using Lean UX methodologies.

          <p class="date-text">Lean Canvas</p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            A lean canvas focuses on problems, solutions, key metrics, competitive advantages, customer segments, early adopters,
            cost structure, and revenue stream. We created our chart basing our early adopters as stressed, young college students 
            who frequently use their smartphones. The main problem we attempted to tackle was the difficulty our early adopters had 
            in finding time to practice self-care. 
          </p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            Our solution is to design and develop a mobile application that would be integrated into our users' daily schedules.
            Something that would set the app apart would be its augmented reality (AR) capabilities. The main cost we pinpointed
            is development fees, but ideally we would be able to make it back through donations and cosmetics.
          </p>

          <p class="date-text">Value Proposition</p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            Value propositions communicate to customers what value is being delivered and how it will be given.
            We list out our customers' supposed needs and how our product may solve it.
          </p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            Our main goals are to teach users self-care techniques and to make them a habit in their lives.
            Based on these goals, we would create an AR diary in the form of a virtual plant that must be taken care of.
            Users can take pride and ownership by sharing their plants on social media, similar to Pokemon Go. 
            In order to foster an affordable and comfortable experience, our app would send positive reinforcement and would be
            completely free.

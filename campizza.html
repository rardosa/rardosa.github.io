          <p class="date-text">April 2019 - June 2019</p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            Camp Izza is a summer camp for children aged 5-11, located in Irvine, California.
            In order to promote social good for our UX project, four classmates and I wanted to redesign
            their website for a better user experience. At the time, the website had many unclear signifiers and affordances,
            gaps in information, and did not support recovery from mistakes.
          </p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            I worked as a UX researcher and designer for this project, using Adobe XD as my medium.

          <p class="date-text">Competitive Analysis</p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            We named two direct competitors, Outta Bound Events and Camp James.
            The first is a non-profit organization that provides afterschool/summer programs from children aged 5 to 14.
            The second is a summer camp for children aged 4 to 13.
          </p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            Our indirect competitors are SuperCamp by Quantum Learning and Orange County Ripken (OCCR).
            SuperCamp is aimed for older children, from sixth grade all the way to college students.
            They're focused on teaching classes about life skills. 
            OCCR is an organization for children 3-18 that offers softball and baseball programs. 
          </p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            Looking at our competitors' websites, it is clear that each had better information hierarchy.
            In particular, Outta Bounds contained more information about each program in their pages and had a better navigation bar.
            Another advantage the site had is a clear color palette. They stuck to a few colors and fonts which made 
            it easier on the users' eyes and establish branding. The competitive analysis solidified our goals and served
            as a confirmation that the problems we aimed for our redesign will help Camp Izza stand beside its competitors.
          </p>
          <p class="date-text">Interviews and Surveys</p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            We conducted a total of 10 interviews on parents, our primary stakeholders. We used Facebook
            as the platform to distribute our surveys made using Google Forms and used their built-in analytics.
            We decided that the best way to organize our findings is by creating affinity maps.

          </div>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            From our affinity maps, we decided to create our personas. We created a total
            of three with varying backgrounds and personality traits.
          </p>

          <p class="date-text">Cognitive Walkthrough</p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            Our second user testing method was a cognitive walkthrough.
            We did a total of five. 
            We created an action sequence for navigating the website, signing up a child for summer camp,
            looking through the calendar for daily activities, finding financial aid, and signing up for Lunch Mob, their associate meal provider.
            We then answered four questions:  
          </p>
          <ol class="ml-3 write-up-text">
            <li>What is the user trying to achieve at this point? (What is their goal? Why is it their goal?)</li>
            <li>Are the necessary actions obviously available in the interface?</li>
            <li>Once users see the control, will they recognize that it does what they want?
              In other words, does the label for the correct action match the user's goals?
              What are plausible reasons why a user might not recognize that the control does what they want?
            </li>
            <li>If the user performs the correct action, will they get good feedback and not try to undo or redo the aciton?</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <!-- Identified Problems -->
        <div class="smaller-space-in-between">
          <h1 class="yellow-title name-head">Pain Points</h1>
          <p class="date-text">Information is difficult to find.</p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            The information architecture of the website made it hard for users to find
            the information they were looking for. It often led users to remain "stuck" in their
            user flow and ultimately led them away from Camp Izza's services.
          </p>
          <p class="date-text">The UI is inconsistent.</p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            The visual aesthetic of the website was inconsistent.
            Thus, affordances, such as buttons or links, were unclear for the user.
            Was the button clickable, or was it simply text? Some color combinations and fonts made
            reading near impossible in certain pages.
          </p>
          <p class="date-text">Website exploration is annoying.</p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            There is no easy back button. Sometimes, user navigation is abruptly cut short because there's no button 
            that takes the user back to where they were before they made a mistake. 
            If input information is wrong, users had to re-do an entire form because their
            progress wasn't saved.
          </p>

        <!-- Redesign -->

          <h1 class="yellow-title name-head">Redesign</h1>
          <p class="date-text">Creating a more consistent visual design.</p>
          <p class="write-up-text">We created a simpler color palette, sticking to six colors with gray and black for text.
            Moving away from bright colors, we came up with an earthy, neutral color story to better appeal to parents and create a modern, professional feel.
            We also stuck to one font (Open Sans) to be used in all of our assets

          <div class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-5 mb-5">

          <p class="date-text">Adding more information about the program.</p> 
          <p class="write-up-text">Our users were often confused on the amenities the camp had to offer such as the Lunch Mob Program,
            activities kids participated in throughout the day, and signing up for financial aid.
          </p>
          <div class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-5 mb-5">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/camp izza/lunchmob.png" alt="Lunch mob redesign">
          </div>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            Initially, the Lunch Mob page would only contain a link instead of explaining to potential parents the services they provided for the camp. We added the Learn More button to act as the gateway to an external site, but we also created a section for a menu so that parents are aware of the type of meals their children could be eating. Underneath, the prices are listed with an appropriate Sign Up button that will link users to a check-out page where they can input their payment.
          </p>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            Moving on to the activities page, the original calendar on their website was a static image that simply had the calendar date and theme of the day.
          </p> 
          <div class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-5 mb-5">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/camp izza/original-calendar.png" alt="Original calendar design">
          </div>
          <p class="write-up-text">
            Our redesign aimed at making the calendar more interactable. Instead of displaying the full month, the calendar would be split into a week with five days. The left would keep the theme and date, while the right window aimed at showing a description of the activities, how many children signed up, how many staff are present, and the time. These are all essential information that our users from surveys and interviews requested.

          <p class="write-up-text">
            The contact page is one example of "hidden" information. Most of our users were not able to find Employment Opportunities since they assumed the contact tab was a means of communication for customers, not possible employees. Our redesign focused on presenting information in a clearer manner.
          </p>

          <p class="write-up-text">
            In our redesign, the upper left is dedicated for future or current customers. The upper right focuses on interested parties who would like to help out with camp. Finally, the bottom is dedicated to contact information, location, and social media handles.

            <h1 class="yellow-title name-head">Reflection</h1>
            <p class="date-text">Finding users is hard.</p>
            <p class="write-up-text">User research requires... you guess it... users! Unfortunately, we were not able to get in touch with our primary stakeholders. We compromised by finding potential users instead: parents with children and would use summer camp programs like Camp Izza. Most of our interviews were conducted through phones and our surveys were posted on platforms such as Facebook groups aimed at moms and the Irvine neighborhood.</p>
            <p class="date-text">Successful redesigns require research.</p>
            <p class="write-up-text">All of our design decisions had something to back it up. We changed how buttons looked because user testing showed that people had trouble finding the next step to their user flow. We added information based on what our users said they would like to see. Though researching is long and tedious, ultimately, each design choice was informed and backed by real needs. We didn't change the layout because it simply looked better; we did it to improve user retention and prevent user errors.</p>
